This is the plugin. It is updated from *ponteggio-development* playground on every numbered version.

---

Ponteggio is a plugin for easy and customizable scaffolding. It is not a scaffold generator and it is not a complete CRUD-management system (or, better, does not *have* to be). You can easily create the seven CRUD methods and the respective views:

bc.. controller SomeObjectController < ApplicationController

	ponteggio SomeObject, :crud

end

p. And that's it! Sometimes, you want to redefine the column kind (maybe it cannot be guessed from the schema and reflections), throw in sorting (using _SearchLogic_) or change _has_many_ association view from comma-separated to multi-line.

bc.. controller SomeObjectController < ApplicationController

	ponteggio SomeObject, :crud
	
	column :article_body, :kind => :wysiwyg
	column :title, :sortable => true
	column :watchers, :list => :long

end

p. Easy!

The best thing is that you needn't to stick to this, but you can just reuse _some_ parts of Ponteggio.
